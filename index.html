    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
      <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
      command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
      everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
      Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
      We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
      learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our

      HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
      <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
      Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
      share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

    <h2>Quotations</h2>

    <p>
      In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the
      Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:
    </p>

    <blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px; background: #fafafa;">
      <p>
        <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em>
        <br>
        â€”Abraham Lincoln
      </p>

    <h2 id="founders">Founders</h2>
      <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
      Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
      sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
      <strong>at least a billion people</strong>, and probably more.

      Michael is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">
      Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
      <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
      introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
      <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
      plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
      are slightly exaggerated.

      When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
      on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
      interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
      interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

      You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
      Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
      at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
      tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
